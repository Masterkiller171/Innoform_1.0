        <strong><h1>About us</h1></strong>
        <p>We are with a group of two riding an adventure trough discoveries. The initial goal of this project was that we had to do a school project.
        But after a few weeks of expermenting and learning, we enlighted ourselves to website programming. We not just did it as for a school project, but also as an experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Introducing</h2>
        <p>We both never had any experience with web development. But that doesn't stop our adventure. We both followed our paths. But futher a do, let's introduce ourselves.
        The team exists out of two individuals. Youri and Tijmen. We both have a passion for development in the field. And building digital software. We're from the Netherlands.
        Youri is 16 years old and Tijmen almost 18. We're last year, high school students. </p>
        <h2>Idea and execution</h2>
        <p>
            The idea of this website, is to connect people all of the world. Not just to communicate, but to give help to those who need it. We want to gather all people allround the world
            who have troubles and people who solve them. We always wanted to connect people, but that's not always possible. 
            <br><br>
            There're millions of website out there on the net. But almost none of them specializes them self for people who need help on an expert level. And so we thought wthat it would be a great
            idea to make a website for those people. Ofcourse, there are website's like Reddit and such. But Reddit doesn't specialize in anything. It's meant for all people and not just for people who need help.         
        </p>
